# CLI & Runbook

A professional application often needs a command-line interface (CLI) for administrative tasks like starting the server, running migrations, or seeding the database. We use **Artisanal** to build a Laravel-style CLI for our movie catalog.

## Artisanal CLI

The CLI is defined in `bin/cli.dart`. It uses a command-based structure where each task is a separate command.

<Tabs groupId="cli">
  <TabItem value="runner" label="Entry Point">
    The entry point initializes the CLI and registers the available commands.
    ```dart file=../../../../packages/ormed/example/fullstack/bin/cli.dart#cli-runner
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="serve" label="Serve Command">
    Starts the Shelf server.
    ```dart file=../../../../packages/ormed/example/fullstack/bin/cli.dart#cli-serve
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="migrate" label="Migrate Command">
    Runs the database migrations.
    ```dart file=../../../../packages/ormed/example/fullstack/bin/cli.dart#cli-migrate
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="seed" label="Seed Command">
    Seeds the database with initial data.
    ```dart file=../../../../packages/ormed/example/fullstack/bin/cli.dart#cli-seed
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Runbook

Here's a quick reference for the common commands you'll use during development:

### 1. Code Generation
Run this whenever you change your models or add new ones.
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 2. Database Setup
Prepare your database by running migrations and seeding it with data.
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
dart run ormed_cli:ormed migrate

# Run the database seeders
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed
```

### 3. Running Tests
Ensure everything is working correctly.
```bash
dart test
```

### 4. Starting the Server
You can start the server directly or via the Artisanal CLI.
```bash
# Start server directly
dart run bin/server.dart

# Start server using the CLI (recommended)
dart run bin/cli.dart serve
```
