# Full‑Stack Movie Catalog (Shelf + Ormed)

Welcome to the Full-Stack Movie Catalog tutorial! In this guide, we'll build a complete web application from scratch using **Ormed** for database persistence and **Shelf** for the web server.

## Prerequisites

- [Quick Start](../../getting-started/quick-start)
- Basic familiarity with Dart and Shelf-style handlers

## What You’ll Learn

- How Ormed integrates into a real server-side app architecture
- How models, migrations, API routes, templates, storage, and tests fit together
- How to run a production-style workflow from one tutorial path

This isn't just a "Hello World" example. We'll build a meaningful application that includes:
- **Database Modeling**: Defining structured data with relations.
- **Migrations & Seeding**: Managing schema changes and initial data.
- **Web Routing**: Handling both HTML pages and JSON API endpoints.
- **Template Rendering**: Using Liquify for dynamic HTML.
- **File Storage**: Handling image uploads for movie posters.
- **Structured Logging**: Using Contextual for observable applications.
- **Testing**: Ensuring reliability with unit and integration tests.

:::note
This guide is built from a runnable example project in `packages/ormed/example/fullstack` with region markers. Code blocks are embedded directly from the source to keep docs and code in sync.

## What You’ll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a movie catalog app with:
- **Server-rendered pages**: Catalog, detail, edit, delete, and genre listings.
- **REST APIs**: JSON endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **SQLite persistence**: Using Ormed models and migrations.
- **Layout inheritance**: Clean templates with shared layouts.
- **Asset uploads**: Storing movie posters on disk.
- **Observability**: Structured logging for easier debugging.

## Guide Map

1. [**Setup & Scaffolding**](./setup) - Initialize the project and dependencies.
2. [**Models & Codegen**](./models) - Define your data structure.
3. [**Migrations & Seed Data**](./migrations-seeds) - Prepare your database.
4. [**Server & Web Routes**](./server-routes) - Build the web application.
5. [**JSON API**](./api) - Expose your data via REST.
6. [**Templates & Storage**](./templates-storage) - UI and file handling.
7. [**Testing Strategy**](./testing) - Verify your work.
8. [**CLI & Runbook**](./cli-runbook) - Manage the app.
