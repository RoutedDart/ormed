# Guides Overview

Guides focus on operating Ormed in real applications: testing, multi-database setups, observability, and production guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start)
- [Queries Overview](../queries/overview)

## What You’ll Learn

- Which guide to use for your immediate goal
- How to progress from one service to production-scale patterns
