# Adopt Ormed In An Existing Project

This guide is for teams integrating Ormed into an already running Dart service.

## Prerequisites

- [Installation](./installation)
- Familiarity with your current DB schema and deployment flow

## What You’ll Learn

- How to add Ormed without rewriting the whole app
- How to scaffold generated runtime config into an existing codebase
- How to choose a safe migration strategy for existing databases

## Integration Strategy

Use this sequence:

1. Add Ormed packages and generate code.
2. Introduce a `DataSource` bootstrap path behind a small adapter layer.
3. Move one model/query path at a time.
4. Adopt migrations only after deciding ownership boundaries.

## 1. Add Dependencies

Pick your runtime driver and install:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ormed: ^0.2.0
  ormed_sqlite: ^0.2.0 # or ormed_postgres / ormed_mysql / ormed_d1

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
  ormed_cli: ^0.2.0
```

```bash
dart pub get
```

## 2. Scaffold Runtime Files

From project root:

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:ormed init
```

This adds `lib/src/database/config.dart` and `lib/src/database/datasource.dart` so runtime wiring is code-first by default.

## 3. Add Ormed Models Gradually

Create/annotate model files in `lib/src/models/` and generate:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Generated output (`*.orm.dart` + `orm_registry.g.dart`) stays alongside your existing code and can be adopted incrementally.

## 4. Bootstrap DataSource In App Startup

Wire Ormed once during app startup:

```dart
import 'src/database/datasource.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final ds = createDataSource();
  await ds.init();

  // existing application startup...
}
```

## 5. Choose Migration Ownership

For existing databases, pick one approach and document it in your repo:

- Ormed-owned going forward:
  - keep historical schema as-is
  - add a baseline migration entry representing current state
  - use `ormed make` / `ormed migrate` for all new changes
- Externally managed schema:
  - continue current migration tool
  - use Ormed primarily for models/queries/runtime access

## 6. Move Endpoints In Slices

Do not migrate everything at once. Port one endpoint/repository at a time, validate behavior, then proceed.

Recommended order:

1. Read-only queries
2. Simple writes
3. Transaction-heavy paths
