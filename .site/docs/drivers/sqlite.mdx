# SQLite

SQLite is the default scaffold for new projects. It runs without external services and is great for local development, CLI tools, and fast integration tests.

## Install

Add the driver package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ormed: ^latest
  ormed_sqlite: ^latest
```

## Configure (orm.yaml)

```yaml
driver:
  type: sqlite
  options:
    database: database.sqlite   # relative to project root
```

## Use in code (DataSource)

```dart file=../../examples/lib/drivers/sqlite.dart#sqlite-datasource
```

## SQLite Migrations Helpers

Import the SQLite migrations entrypoint to use SQLite-specific column aliases:

```dart
import 'package:ormed_sqlite/migrations.dart';
```

Available helpers:
- `blob()` → BLOB (alias for `binary()`)
- `real()` → REAL (alias for `float()`)
- `numeric()` → NUMERIC (alias for `decimal()`)

### In-memory (tests)

```dart file=../../examples/lib/drivers/sqlite.dart#sqlite-inmemory
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `database` | `String` | `database.sqlite` | Path to the `.sqlite` file (relative to project root or absolute). |
| `path` | `String?` | — | Alias for `database` used by some programmatic helpers. |
| `memory` | `bool` | `false` | When true, connects to an in-memory database (tests / ephemeral usage). |

### Notes

- The adapter automatically enables `RETURNING` support and schema inspection.
- Migrations and seeds are configured separately in `orm.yaml`. See Getting Started → Configuration.
- For plan/previews/schema internals, see Drivers → Internals.
