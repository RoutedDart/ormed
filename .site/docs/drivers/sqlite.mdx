# SQLite

SQLite is the default scaffold for new projects. It runs without external services and is great for local development, CLI tools, and fast integration tests.

## orm.yaml

```yaml
driver:
  type: sqlite
  options:
    database: database.sqlite   # relative to project root
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `database` | `String` | `database.sqlite` | Path to the `.sqlite` file (relative to project root or absolute). |

### Notes

- The adapter automatically enables `RETURNING` support and schema inspection.
- Migrations and seeds are configured separately in `orm.yaml`. See Getting Started → Configuration.
