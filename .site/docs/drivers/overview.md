# Drivers

Ormed ships first‑party adapters for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL/MariaDB. Each driver plugs into the same `orm.yaml` shape: set `driver.type`, then pass driver-specific connection options under `driver.options`. Migrations and seeds work the same across drivers; only the connection block changes.

- **SQLite** — zero‑dependency file or in‑memory database, ideal for local development and fast tests.
- **PostgreSQL** — full‑featured SQL with rich JSON, window functions, and robust migrations at scale.
- **MySQL / MariaDB** — common production backend with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` support and JSON columns.

Pick the driver that matches your runtime environment; you can keep the rest of your Ormed code identical and switch by changing the active connection in `orm.yaml`.
