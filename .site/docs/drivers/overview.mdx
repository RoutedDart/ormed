# Drivers

Ormed ships first‑party driver adapters for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL/MariaDB.

Drivers are distributed as separate packages (e.g. `ormed_sqlite`). The core `ormed` package depends only on the `DriverAdapter` interface.

- **SQLite** — zero‑dependency file or in‑memory database, ideal for local development and fast tests.
- **PostgreSQL** — full‑featured SQL with rich JSON, window functions, and robust migrations at scale.
- **MySQL / MariaDB** — common production backend with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` support and JSON columns.

You can use a driver in three ways:

1) **CLI/config driven** via `ormed.yaml` (`driver.type` + `driver.options`)  
2) **Hybrid** via `DataSource.fromConfig(config)` (resolves driver from config automatically)
3) **Programmatically** via `DataSourceOptions(driver: ...)`

### Driver Registration

To use the config-driven or hybrid approach, you must ensure the driver is registered with the `DriverAdapterRegistry`. This is typically done by calling the registration helper provided by the driver package:

```dart
import 'package:ormed_sqlite/ormed_sqlite.dart';

void main() {
  ensureSqliteDriverRegistration();
  // ...
}
```

The `ormed init` command automatically scaffolds this registration in your `lib/src/database/datasource.dart` file.

Pick the driver that matches your runtime environment; you can keep the rest of your Ormed code identical and switch by changing the active connection in `ormed.yaml` or the adapter you pass to `DataSourceOptions`.

## Driver internals

If you are building tools, debugging query output, or implementing a custom adapter, see:

- [Driver Internals](./internals/overview) — plans, previews, and execution flow
- [Plans & Previews](./internals/plans) — `QueryPlan` / `MutationPlan` and `StatementPreview`
- [Schema](./internals/schema) — `SchemaDriver`, `SchemaInspector`, and schema state
