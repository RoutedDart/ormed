# Drivers

Ormed ships first‑party driver adapters for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL/MariaDB.

Drivers are distributed as separate packages (e.g. `ormed_sqlite`). The core `ormed` package depends only on the `DriverAdapter` interface.

- **SQLite** — zero‑dependency file or in‑memory database, ideal for local development and fast tests.
- **PostgreSQL** — full‑featured SQL with rich JSON, window functions, and robust migrations at scale.
- **MySQL / MariaDB** — common production backend with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` support and JSON columns.

You can use a driver in two ways:

1) **CLI/config driven** via `orm.yaml` (`driver.type` + `driver.options`)  
2) **Programmatically** via `DataSourceOptions(driver: ...)`

Pick the driver that matches your runtime environment; you can keep the rest of your Ormed code identical and switch by changing the active connection in `orm.yaml` or the adapter you pass to `DataSourceOptions`.
