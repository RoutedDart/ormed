# Running Migrations

## Prerequisites

- [Migrations Overview](./overview)
- [Schema Builder](./schema-builder)

## What You’ll Learn

- How to apply/rollback migrations programmatically
- How migration ledger state is tracked
- How to inspect migration status safely

:::note Snippet context
These snippets are split by step (entries → ledger → runner → apply/rollback) so you can copy just the part you need.

## Programmatic Usage

Use `MigrationRunner` to run migrations in code:

### 1) Define entries

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-entries
```

### 2) Create a ledger

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-ledger
```

### 3) Create the runner

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-runner
```

### 4) Apply / rollback

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-apply
```

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-rollback
```

### 5) Inspect status

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-runner-status
```

## Ledger API

The ledger tracks which migrations have been applied:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/migrations/runner.dart#migration-ledger
```

## Migration Registry

The CLI maintains a registry file to track available migrations:

<Tabs groupId="migration-registry" defaultValue="registry">
  <TabItem value="imports" label="Imports marker">

New migrations are inserted between the import tags:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/src/database/migrations.dart#migrations-registry-imports
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="registry" label="Registry marker">

Each migration registers an id + migration instance:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/src/database/migrations.dart#migrations-registry-entries
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="build" label="buildMigrations()">

The CLI (and your code) asks the registry for descriptors:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/src/database/migrations.dart#migrations-registry-build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The marker comments allow the CLI to automatically insert new migrations.

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Already Applied

```
Error: Migration X has already been applied
```

Use `migrate:status` to check applied migrations. Roll back first if you need to re-run.

### Checksum Mismatch

```
Error: Migration checksum doesn't match recorded value
```

A migration was modified after being applied. Either:
- Revert changes to the migration file
- Create a new migration with the changes

### Foreign Key Constraint Failed

Ensure:
- Parent tables are created before child tables
- Child tables are dropped before parent tables
- Foreign key columns match the referenced column type
