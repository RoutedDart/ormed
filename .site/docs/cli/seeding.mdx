# Seeding (CLI)

Seeders run through the seeder registry entrypoint.

## Prerequisites

- [CLI Overview](./overview)
- [Migrations (CLI)](./migrations)

## What You’ll Learn

- How to run all or selected seeders
- How pretend mode works for safe previews
- Which registry paths CLI expects for seeding

## Step Outcome

By the end of this page, you should be able to:

- Run full or targeted seeding flows
- Use pretend mode to inspect without mutations
- Validate seeder registry wiring per connection

## Registry defaults

- Convention default registry: `lib/src/database/seeders.dart`
- Optional override via `ormed.yaml` (`seeds.registry`)
- If the scaffold is missing, first `seed`/`migrate --seed` bootstraps seeder files and exits with guidance.

## Run seeders

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed --connection analytics
```

Recommended flow:

1. `seed --pretend`
2. `seed`
3. Verify seeded records with a quick query/integration check

## Run specific seeders

Use `--class` (repeatable / comma-separated) to run specific seeder classes:

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed --class UserSeeder
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed --class UserSeeder,PostSeeder
```

## Pretend mode

Preview statements (when supported by the driver) without executing them:

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed --pretend
```

## Configuration reminder

If you use `ormed.yaml`, include a `seeds` block:

```yaml
seeds:
  directory: lib/src/database/seeders
  registry: lib/src/database/seeders.dart
```

- [Schema tooling (CLI)](./schema)
- [CLI Command Reference](./commands)

## Verify Seeder Wiring

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:ormed seed --pretend
```

If using `ormed.yaml`, verify with explicit connection targeting as well.
