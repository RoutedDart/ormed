# Seeding (CLI)

Seeders are configured in `orm.yaml` and executed by running the seeder registry entrypoint you configured.

## Run seeders

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:orm seed
dart run ormed_cli:orm seed --connection analytics
```

## Run specific seeders

Use `--class` (repeatable / comma-separated) to run specific seeder classes:

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:orm seed --class UserSeeder
dart run ormed_cli:orm seed --class UserSeeder,PostSeeder
```

## Pretend mode

Preview statements (when supported by the driver) without executing them:

```bash
dart run ormed_cli:orm seed --pretend
```

## Configuration reminder

Your `orm.yaml` needs a `seeds` block:

```yaml
seeds:
  directory: lib/src/database/seeders
  registry: lib/src/database/seeders.dart
```
