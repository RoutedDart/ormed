# Queries Overview

Ormed gives you three layers for data access: query builder, repositories, and DataSource orchestration.

## Prerequisites

- [Models Overview](../models/overview)
- [Migrations Overview](../migrations/overview)

## What You’ll Learn

- When to use query builder vs repository vs DataSource APIs
- A practical order for learning query features
- How to scale from simple CRUD to multi-connection workflows

## Step Outcome

By the end of this page, you should know which API layer to use first for your current task.

## Query Layers

- `Query Builder`: fluent typed reads and writes, joins, filters, projections.
- `Repository`: model-oriented create/update/delete workflows.
- `DataSource`: connection lifecycle, transactions, and multi-database routing.

## Quick Decision Guide

- Need custom filtering/joining/projections: start with `Query Builder`.
- Need model-centric write flows (insert/update/delete): use `Repository`.
- Need lifecycle/transactions/connection routing: use `DataSource`.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [Query Builder](./query-builder): core read/write fluency.
2. [Repository](./repository): structured model mutations.
3. [Loading Relations](./relations): association-aware reads.
4. [DataSource](./data-source): boot, connection control, transactions.
5. [JSON Queries](./json) + [Caching](./caching): specialized tuning.
