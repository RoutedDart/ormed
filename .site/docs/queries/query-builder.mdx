# Query Builder

The Query Builder provides a fluent, type-safe API for building database queries.

:::note Snippet context
- Snippets focus on the query builder calls and omit full setup.
- Unless shown otherwise, assume you already have a `DataSource` named `dataSource` (see Getting Started → Quick Start).
:::

## Getting Started

Access the query builder through a `DataSource`:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-getting-started

```

## Selecting Data

### Get All Records

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-get-all

```

### Select Specific Columns

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-select

```

### First Record

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-first

```

### Find by Primary Key

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-find

```

## Where Clauses

<Tabs groupId="query-where-clauses" defaultValue="common">
<TabItem value="common" label="Common patterns">

- Prefer `whereEquals('id', id)` for primary key lookups.
- Use `whereIn` for sets, and `whereBetween` for ranges.
- Group complex logic with `where((q) => ...)` so operator precedence is explicit.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="examples" label="Examples">

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-clauses

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Comparison Operators

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-comparison

```

### In / Not In

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-in

```

### Null Checks

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-null

```

### Between

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-between

```

### Like / Contains

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-like

```

### Or Where

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-or

```

### Grouped Conditions

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#where-grouped

```

## Ordering

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#ordering-limiting

```

## Aggregates

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#aggregates

```

## Distinct

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#distinct

```

## Eager Loading Relations

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#relations

```

## Raw Expressions

When you need database-specific functionality:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#raw-expressions

```

## Partial Projections

Get partial entities with only selected columns:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#partial-projections

```

## Soft Delete Scopes

For models with soft deletes:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#soft-delete-scopes

```

## Query Caching

Cache query results for improved performance:

```dart file=../../examples/lib/queries.dart#query-caching

```
