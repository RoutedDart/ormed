# Model Attributes

Ormed models support **attribute metadata** that affects:

- Mass assignment (`fill`, `fillIfAbsent`, `forceFill`)
- Serialization (`toArray`, `toJson`)
- Casting (see **Models → Casting**)

:::note Tracked models
These APIs are designed for tracked models (the generated `$Model` types) and instances returned by queries. Plain user-defined model instances are immutable and typically not used for mass assignment.
:::

## Define metadata

Attribute metadata can be declared at the model level, and optionally overridden per-field.

```dart file=../../examples/lib/models/attribute_metadata_examples.dart#attributes-model-level
```

## Mass assignment

Mass assignment takes a `Map<String, Object?>` keyed by **column names** and applies `fillable`/`guarded` rules.

```dart file=../../examples/lib/models/attribute_metadata_examples.dart#attributes-fill
```

Notes:
- `fill(...)` defaults to `strict: false` (guarded keys are discarded).
- Set `strict: true` to throw a `MassAssignmentException` when a guarded key is present.
- Use `forceFill(...)` only for trusted/internal flows.

## Serialization (hidden / visible)

`toArray()` / `toJson()` honor `hidden` by default. To include hidden values you must set `includeHidden: true`, and the column must also be listed in `visible`.

```dart file=../../examples/lib/models/attribute_metadata_examples.dart#attributes-serialize
```
