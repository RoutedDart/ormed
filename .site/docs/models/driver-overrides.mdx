# Driver Overrides

Some databases differ in their **best column types** (and sometimes their **best codecs**) for the same Dart field. Ormed supports expressing those differences on a per-field basis with `@OrmField(driverOverrides: ...)`.

This is useful when:
- A field should be `jsonb` on PostgreSQL, but `TEXT` on SQLite.
- One driver returns JSON values as a `Map`, while another returns a JSON string (and needs a different codec).

## Field overrides (`driverOverrides`)

Define per-driver overrides keyed by the driver name (lowercased):

```dart file=../../examples/lib/models/driver_overrides_examples.dart#driver-overrides-field
```

Notes:
- Keys are normalized (trimmed + lowercased) before matching.
- Keys should match `driver.metadata.name` (for example: `sqlite`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`).
- Overrides can change `columnType`, `defaultValueSql`, and `codec`.

## Model driver annotations (`driverAnnotations`)

`@OrmModel(driverAnnotations: [...])` attaches marker annotations to the generated model definition. A driver can use these to opt into custom hooks or behavior for a subset of models.

```dart file=../../examples/lib/models/driver_overrides_examples.dart#driver-annotations-model
```
