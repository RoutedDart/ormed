# Models Overview

Models are the source of truth for your domain: fields, relationships, casts, lifecycle behavior, and helper methods.

## Prerequisites

- [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start)
- [Code Generation](../getting-started/code-generation)

## What You’ll Learn

- How to move from plain Dart classes to production model design
- Which model features to adopt first versus later
- A practical reading order for the model docs

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [Defining Models](./defining-models): shape entities and table mapping.
2. [Attributes](./attributes) + [Casting](./casting): field behavior and serialization.
3. [Relationships](./relationships): connect models with associations.
4. [Timestamps](./timestamps) + [Soft Deletes](./soft-deletes): lifecycle conventions.
5. [Scopes](./scopes) + [Model Methods](./model-methods): reusable query and domain behavior.
6. [Events](./events) + [Driver Overrides](./driver-overrides): advanced hooks and per-driver tuning.

## Day-1 vs Advanced

- Day-1: defining models, attributes/casts, relationships.
- Once stable: scopes, methods, events.
- Driver-specific behavior: add overrides only where needed.
