# Introduction

Ormed is a **strongly-typed ORM for Dart** inspired by Eloquent, GORM, SQLAlchemy, and ActiveRecord. It combines compile-time code generation with runtime flexibility to deliver type-safe database operations.

## Features

- **Type-safe queries** - Fluent query builder with compile-time type checking
- **Code generation** - Automatic generation of model definitions, codecs, and helpers
- **Flexible input handling** - Accept tracked models, DTOs, or raw maps for CRUD operations
- **Relationship support** - hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany with eager/lazy loading
- **Soft deletes** - Built-in support for soft delete patterns
- **Timestamps** - Automatic timestamp management for created_at/updated_at
- **Migrations** - Fluent schema builder with reversible migrations
- **Multi-database** - Support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Value codecs** - Custom type serialization between Dart and database

```dart file=../examples/lib/models/user.dart#intro-model
