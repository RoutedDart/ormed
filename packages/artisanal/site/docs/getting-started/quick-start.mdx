# Quick Start

Let's build a simple counter application to see how Artisanal works.

## 1. Define the Model

The model represents the state of your application.

```dart file=../../../example/tui/counter.dart#model
```

## 2. Run the Program

Use the `Program` class to start the TUI loop.

```dart
void main() {
  final program = tui.Program(CounterModel.initial());
  program.run();
}
```

## 3. Run the Application

```bash
dart run bin/main.dart
```
