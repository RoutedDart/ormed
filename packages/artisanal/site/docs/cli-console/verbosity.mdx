# Verbosity

Artisanal includes a built-in verbosity system that allows you to control the level of detail in your CLI output.

## Verbosity Levels

There are four standard verbosity levels:

- `Verbosity.quiet`: Only essential output (e.g., errors).
- `Verbosity.normal`: Standard output (default).
- `Verbosity.verbose`: Detailed output for debugging.
- `Verbosity.debug`: Maximum detail, including internal logs.

## Using Verbosity with Console

The `Console` class respects the current verbosity level.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#verbosity_usage_example
```

## Global Verbosity

You can also set a global verbosity level that is used by default.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#global_verbosity_example
```
