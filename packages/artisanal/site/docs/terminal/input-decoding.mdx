# Input Decoding

Artisanal includes a high-performance ANSI input decoder that translates raw terminal byte streams into structured events.

## Key Events

The `Key` class represents a keyboard event, including:

- `type`: The type of key (e.g., `KeyType.enter`, `KeyType.backspace`, `KeyType.up`, `KeyType.runes`).
- `runes`: The character data for printable keys.
- `alt`, `ctrl`, `shift`: Modifier flags.

## Mouse Events

When mouse tracking is enabled, the decoder produces `MouseMsg` events:

- `x`, `y`: Coordinates of the event.
- `type`: The type of mouse action (e.g., `MouseType.press`, `MouseType.release`, `MouseType.motion`, `MouseType.wheelUp`).
- `button`: Which button was involved.

## Event Decoder

The `EventDecoder` (from `uv.dart`) is the low-level engine used by the TUI runtime to handle input. It supports advanced protocols like the Kitty Keyboard Protocol for disambiguated key events.

```dart
final decoder = EventDecoder();
final events = decoder.decode(bytes);

for (final event in events) {
  if (event is KeyEvent) {
    print('Key pressed: ${event.key}');
  }
}
```
