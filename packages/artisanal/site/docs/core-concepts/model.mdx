# Model

The `Model` is the heart of your Artisanal application. It is an immutable representation of your application's state at any given point in time.

## The `Model` Interface

Every Artisanal application must implement the `Model` interface:

```dart
abstract interface class Model {
  /// Returns an optional command to run when the program starts.
  Cmd? init();

  /// Handles incoming messages and returns a new model and an optional command.
  (Model, Cmd?) update(Msg msg);

  /// Renders the current state of the model.
  /// Can return a [String] or a [View] object.
  Object view();
}
```

## Immutability

It is highly recommended to keep your models immutable. When the state changes, you should return a new instance of the model from the `update` method. This makes your application easier to reason about and test.

```dart file=../../../example/tui/counter.dart#model_example
```
