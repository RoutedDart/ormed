# Commands

Commands (`Cmd`) are used to perform asynchronous operations and side effects in Artisanal. They are returned by the `init` and `update` methods.

## The Cmd Class

A `Cmd` is essentially a wrapper around a function that returns a `Future<Msg?>`.

```dart
class Cmd {
  final Future<Msg?> Function() execute;
  // ...
}
```

## Built-in Commands

Artisanal provides several built-in commands:

- **Cmd.quit()**: Exits the application.
- **Cmd.tick(duration, callback)**: Triggers a message after a certain duration.
- **Cmd.batch(commands)**: Runs multiple commands in parallel.
- **Cmd.none()**: Does nothing.

## Custom Commands

You can create custom commands to perform any asynchronous task:

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#custom_cmd_example
```

## Batching Commands

If you need to run multiple commands at once, use `Cmd.batch`:

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#batch_cmd_example
```

## The `init` Command

The `init` method of your model returns the initial command to run when the application starts. This is often used to trigger initial data loading or start background processes.

```dart file=../../../example/tui/examples/simple/main.dart#cmd_tick
```
