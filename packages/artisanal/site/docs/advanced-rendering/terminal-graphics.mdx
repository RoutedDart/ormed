# Terminal Graphics

Artisanal and Ultraviolet support advanced terminal graphics, including high-resolution images and complex shapes.

## Kitty Image Protocol

Artisanal includes built-in support for the **Kitty Graphics Protocol**, which allows displaying high-quality images directly in the terminal.

```dart file=../../../example/uv/image.dart#image_rendering_usage
```

## Sixel Support

(Coming Soon) Support for the Sixel graphics protocol is planned for a future release.

## Braille Graphics

For terminals that don't support image protocols, Artisanal provides a `Canvas` API that uses Braille characters to render high-resolution vector graphics (2x4 dots per character).

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#canvas_example
```

## Half-Block Graphics

Another common technique for terminal graphics is using half-block characters (`▀`, `▄`) to double the vertical resolution.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#half_block_example
```
