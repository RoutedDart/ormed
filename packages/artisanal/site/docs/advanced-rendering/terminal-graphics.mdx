# Terminal Graphics

Artisanal and Ultraviolet support advanced terminal graphics, including high-resolution images and complex shapes.

## Kitty Image Protocol

Artisanal includes built-in support for the **Kitty Graphics Protocol**, which allows displaying high-quality images directly in the terminal.

```dart
final image = KittyImage.fromFile('path/to/image.png');
terminal.drawImage(image, x: 10, y: 5);
```

## Sixel Support

(Coming Soon) Support for the Sixel graphics protocol is planned for a future release.

## Braille Graphics

For terminals that don't support image protocols, Artisanal provides a `Canvas` API that uses Braille characters to render high-resolution vector graphics (2x4 dots per character).

```dart
final canvas = Canvas(width: 160, height: 100);
canvas.drawLine(0, 0, 160, 100);
canvas.drawCircle(80, 50, 30);

// Render canvas to a string using Braille characters
String output = canvas.render();
```

## Half-Block Graphics

Another common technique for terminal graphics is using half-block characters (`▀`, `▄`) to double the vertical resolution.

```dart
final hb = HalfBlockBuffer(width: 80, height: 48); // 48 logical rows in 24 terminal rows
hb.setPixel(10, 20, Color.red);
String output = hb.render();
```
