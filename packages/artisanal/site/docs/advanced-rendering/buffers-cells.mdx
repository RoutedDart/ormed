# Buffers & Cells

At the core of the Ultraviolet (UV) renderer is a cell-based buffering system. This allows for precise control over every character on the terminal screen.

## Cells

A `Cell` represents a single character position on the terminal. It contains:

- `content`: The character (grapheme) to display.
- `style`: The `UvStyle` (foreground, background, attributes).
- `link`: An optional terminal hyperlink.

## Buffers

A `Buffer` is a 2D grid of cells. UV uses two buffers: the "current" buffer (what is currently on the screen) and the "next" buffer (what we want to display).

```dart
final buffer = Buffer(width: 80, height: 24);

// Set a cell at (x, y)
buffer.setCell(10, 5, Cell(
  content: 'A',
  style: UvStyle(fg: UvColor.ansi(1)),
));
```

## Wide Characters

UV's buffer system correctly handles wide characters (like Emojis or CJK characters) that occupy two terminal columns. When a wide character is set, the buffer automatically manages the "placeholder" cell in the next column to prevent rendering artifacts.
