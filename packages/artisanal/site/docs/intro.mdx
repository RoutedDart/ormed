# Introduction to Artisanal

Artisanal is a sophisticated Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework for Dart, heavily inspired by the Go ecosystem (Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, and Ultraviolet). It provides a predictable, state-driven way to build interactive terminal applications using **The Elm Architecture (TEA)**.

## Key Features

- **The Elm Architecture (TEA)**: A robust pattern for managing state, updates, and rendering.
- **Sophisticated Styling**: A fluent, chainable `Style` API inspired by Lipgloss.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: The Ultraviolet (UV) renderer uses cell-buffer diffing to minimize ANSI output and eliminate flicker.
- **Rich Component Library**: A collection of "Bubbles" components like Viewports, Text Inputs, Progress Bars, and more.
- **Terminal Graphics**: Support for Kitty, iTerm2, and Sixel graphics protocols.
- **Adaptive Themes**: Built-in support for light/dark mode adaptation and semantic color palettes.

## Why Artisanal?

Building terminal applications can be complex due to the variety of terminal capabilities, escape sequences, and the need for efficient rendering. Artisanal abstracts these complexities away, allowing you to focus on your application logic while providing a modern, responsive user experience in the terminal.
