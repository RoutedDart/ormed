# Argument Parsing

Artisanal provides a powerful command-line argument parsing system built on top of `package:args`. It adds support for nested commands, automatic help generation with Lip Gloss styling, and integration with the `Console`.

## CommandRunner

The `CommandRunner` is the main class for managing commands and subcommands.

```dart file=../../../example/main.dart#command_runner_usage
```

## Defining Commands

To create a command, extend the `Command` class.

```dart file=../../../example/main.dart#command_definition_usage
```

## Automatic Help

Artisanal automatically generates beautiful, styled help messages for your CLI.

```bash
$ my-cli --help
```
