# Components (Bubbles) Overview

Artisanal includes a collection of reusable TUI components called "Bubbles". These components are built using the same TEA pattern as the main application, making them easy to compose and manage.

## ViewComponent

A `ViewComponent` is a specialized model designed for composition. It implements an `update` method that returns a new version of itself and an optional command.

```dart
abstract class ViewComponent {
  (ViewComponent, Cmd?) update(Msg msg);
  String view();
}
```

## ComponentHost

The `ComponentHost` mixin simplifies hosting child components in your main model. It provides a way to delegate messages to child components and handle their commands.

```dart file=../../../example/tui/component_host_demo.dart#component_host
```
