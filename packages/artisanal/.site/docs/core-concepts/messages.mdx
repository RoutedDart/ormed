# Messages

Messages (`Msg`) are the only way to trigger state updates in an Artisanal application. They represent events that happen, such as user input, timer ticks, or the completion of an asynchronous task.

## The Msg Class

All messages must extend the `Msg` class:

```dart
abstract class Msg {
  const Msg();
}
```

## Built-in Messages

Artisanal provides several built-in message types:

- **KeyMsg**: Triggered when a key is pressed.
- **MouseMsg**: Triggered by mouse events (clicks, movement, scroll).
- **WindowSizeMsg**: Triggered when the terminal window is resized.
- **FrameTickMsg**: Triggered on every animation frame.

## Custom Messages

You can define your own messages to represent application-specific events:

```dart file=../../../example/tui/examples/simple/main.dart#custom_msg
```

## Message Flow

1. An event occurs (e.g., user presses a key).
2. The `Program` runtime converts the event into a `Msg`.
3. The `Program` calls your model's `update(msg)` method.
4. Your model returns a new state and an optional `Cmd`.
5. The `Program` renders the new state using `view()`.
