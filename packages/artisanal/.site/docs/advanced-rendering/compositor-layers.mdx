# Compositor & Layers

The `Compositor` is a high-level API in Ultraviolet that manages multiple overlapping `Layer`s and blends them into a single output buffer.

## Layers

A `Layer` is an independent drawing surface with its own:
- **ID**: A unique identifier.
- **Position**: (x, y) coordinates relative to the compositor.
- **Size**: Width and height.
- **Z-Index**: Determines the stacking order (higher values are on top).
- **Opacity**: Supports transparency (if the terminal supports it or via blending).
- **Drawable**: A function or object that knows how to render into the layer's buffer.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#layer_example
```

## The Compositor

The `Compositor` maintains a list of layers and handles the rendering process.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#compositor_example
```

## Benefits of Composition

- **Modularity**: Each part of your UI can be managed as a separate layer.
- **Efficiency**: Only layers that have changed need to be re-rendered.
- **Overlays**: Easily implement popups, tooltips, and modals by placing them on higher Z-indexed layers.
- **Clipping**: Layers automatically clip their content to their defined boundaries.
