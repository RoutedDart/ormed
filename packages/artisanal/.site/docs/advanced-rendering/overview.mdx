# Advanced Rendering (Ultraviolet)

Ultraviolet (UV) is Artisanal's high-performance rendering engine. It uses a cell-buffer model and advanced diffing to provide flicker-free, efficient terminal updates.

## How it Works

Unlike traditional TUI rendering which often repaints the entire screen, UV maintains a "current" and "next" buffer of terminal cells. When a frame is rendered, UV:

1.  **Diffs the Buffers**: Identifies exactly which cells have changed.
2.  **Optimizes Movement**: Calculates the most efficient ANSI sequences to move the cursor and update only the changed cells.
3.  **Scroll Optimization**: Detects when lines have been shifted and uses terminal scrolling commands (`IL`/`DL`) to move existing content.

## UV by Default

The Ultraviolet renderer is enabled by default. You can customize its behavior in your `ProgramOptions`:

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#enabling_uv_example
```

## Compositor and Layers

UV includes a powerful composition system that allows you to build your UI using overlapping layers.

```dart file=../../../example/doc_examples.dart#compositor_layers_example
```
